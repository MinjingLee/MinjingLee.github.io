date: July 2022 - Present
path: "project/RF-Front-End"
excerpt: A compact passive LNA with an N-path 1:3 transformer is proposed to replace the bulky step-up spiral transformer, thus consuming less chip area than prior arts. A reconfigurable prototype using an N-path 1:9 transformer is taped out in 55-nm CMOS.
