path: "project/RF-Front-End"
excerpt: We developed a N-Path Filter with 3x Passive Gain and propose a passive LNA by cascoding 3x Gain N-Path Filters to replace conventional transformer, which occupied less chip area than prior arts(To be taped out with 55nm CMOS Technology and measured). A gain-boosted high oreder N-Path filter was also proposed.
